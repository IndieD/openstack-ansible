## Debug and Verbose options.
debug: false

## Common Glance Overrides
# Set glance_default_store to "swift" if using Cloud Files backend
# or "rbd" if using ceph backend; the latter will trigger ceph to get
# installed on glance. If using a file store, a shared file store is
# recommended. See the OpenStack-Ansible install guide and the OpenStack
# documentation for more details.
# Note that "swift" is automatically set as the default back-end if there
# are any swift hosts in the environment. Use this setting to override
# this automation if you wish for a different default back-end.
# glance_default_store: file

## Ceph pool name for Glance to use
# glance_rbd_store_pool: images
# glance_rbd_store_chunk_size: 8

## Common Nova Overrides
# When nova_libvirt_images_rbd_pool is defined, ceph will be installed on nova
# hosts.
# nova_libvirt_images_rbd_pool: vms

# If you wish to change the dhcp_domain configured for both nova and neutron
# dhcp_domain: openstacklocal

## Common Glance Overrides when using a Swift back-end
# By default when 'glance_default_store' is set to 'swift' the playbooks will
# expect to use the Swift back-end that is configured in the same inventory.
# If the Swift back-end is not in the same inventory (ie it is already setup
# through some other means) then these settings should be used.
#
# NOTE: Ensure that the auth version matches your authentication endpoint.
#
# NOTE: If the password for glance_swift_store_key contains a dollar sign ($),
# it must be escaped with an additional dollar sign ($$), not a backslash. For
# example, a password of "super$ecure" would need to be entered as
# "super$$ecure" below.  See Launchpad Bug #1259729 for more details.
#
# glance_swift_store_auth_version: 3
# glance_swift_store_auth_address: "https://some.auth.url.com"
# glance_swift_store_user: "OPENSTACK_TENANT_ID:OPENSTACK_USER_NAME"
# glance_swift_store_key: "OPENSTACK_USER_PASSWORD"
# glance_swift_store_container: "NAME_OF_SWIFT_CONTAINER"
# glance_swift_store_region: "NAME_OF_REGION"

## Common Ceph Overrides
# ceph_mons:
#   - 10.16.5.40
#   - 10.16.5.41
#   - 10.16.5.42

## Custom Ceph Configuration File (ceph.conf)
# By default, your deployment host will connect to one of the mons defined above to
# obtain a copy of your cluster's ceph.conf.  If you prefer, uncomment ceph_conf_file
# and customise to avoid ceph.conf being copied from a mon.
#ceph_conf_file: |
#  [global]
#  fsid = 00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444
#  mon_initial_members = mon1.example.local,mon2.example.local,mon3.example.local
#  mon_host = 10.16.5.40,10.16.5.41,10.16.5.42
#  # optionally, you can use this construct to avoid defining this list twice:
#  # mon_host = {{ ceph_mons|join(',') }}
#  auth_cluster_required = cephx
#  auth_service_required = cephx


# By default, openstack-ansible configures all OpenStack services to talk to
# RabbitMQ over encrypted connections on port 5671. To opt-out of this default,
# set the rabbitmq_use_ssl variable to 'false'. The default setting of 'true'
# is highly recommended for securing the contents of RabbitMQ messages.
# rabbitmq_use_ssl: false

# RabbitMQ management plugin is enabled by default, the guest user has been
# removed for security reasons and a new userid 'monitoring' has been created
# with the 'monitoring' user tag. In order to modify the userid, uncomment the
# following and change 'monitoring' to your userid of choice.
# rabbitmq_monitoring_userid: monitoring


## Additional pinning generator that will allow for more packages to be pinned as you see fit.
## All pins allow for package and versions to be defined. Be careful using this as versions
## are always subject to change and updates regarding security will become your problem from this
## point on. Pinning can be done based on a package version, release, or origin. Use "*" in the
## package name to indicate that you want to pin all package to a particular constraint.
# apt_pinned_packages:
#   - { package: "lxc", version: "1.0.7-0ubuntu0.1" }
#   - { package: "libvirt-bin", version: "1.2.2-0ubuntu13.1.9" }
#   - { package: "rabbitmq-server", origin: "www.rabbitmq.com" }
#   - { package: "*", release: "MariaDB" }


## Environment variable settings
# This allows users to specify the additional environment variables to be set
# which is useful in setting where you working behind a proxy. If working behind
# a proxy It's important to always specify the scheme as "http://". This is what
# the underlying python libraries will handle best. This proxy information will be
# placed both on the hosts and inside the containers.

## Example environment variable setup:
## This is used by apt-cacher-ng to download apt packages:
# proxy_env_url: http://username:pa$$w0rd@10.10.10.9:9000/

## (1) This sets up a permanent environment, used during and after deployment:
# no_proxy_env: "localhost,127.0.0.1,{{ internal_lb_vip_address }},{{ external_lb_vip_address }},{% for host in groups['all_containers'] %}{{ hostvars[host]['container_address'] }}{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}{% endfor %}"
# global_environment_variables:
#   HTTP_PROXY: "{{ proxy_env_url }}"
#   HTTPS_PROXY: "{{ proxy_env_url }}"
#   NO_PROXY: "{{ no_proxy_env }}"
#   http_proxy: "{{ proxy_env_url }}"
#   https_proxy: "{{ proxy_env_url }}"
#   no_proxy: "{{ no_proxy_env }}"
#
## (2) This is applied only during deployment, nothing is left after deployment is complete:
# deployment_environment_variables:
#   http_proxy: "{{ proxy_env_url }}"
#   https_proxy: "{{ proxy_env_url }}"
#   no_proxy: "localhost,127.0.0.1,{{ internal_lb_vip_address }},{{ external_lb_vip_address }},{% for host in groups['keystone_all'] %}{{ hostvars[host]['container_address'] }}{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}{% endfor %}"


## SSH connection wait time
# If an increased delay for the ssh connection check is desired,
# uncomment this variable and set it appropriately.
#ssh_delay: 5


neutron_plugin_base:
  - router
  - metering
  - dns
  - neutron_lbaas.services.loadbalancer.plugin.LoadBalancerPluginv2

## HAProxy and keepalived
# All the previous variables are used inside a var, in the group vars.
# You can override the current keepalived definition (see
# group_vars/all/keepalived.yml) in your user space if necessary.
#
# Uncomment this to disable keepalived installation (cf. documentation)
# haproxy_use_keepalived: False
#
# HAProxy Keepalived configuration (cf. documentation)
# Make sure that this is set correctly according to the CIDR used for your
# internal and external addresses.
# haproxy_keepalived_external_vip_cidr: "{{external_lb_vip_address}}/32"
haproxy_keepalived_external_vip_cidr: "172.16.111.10/32"
# haproxy_keepalived_internal_vip_cidr: "{{internal_lb_vip_address}}/32"
# haproxy_keepalived_external_interface:
# haproxy_keepalived_internal_interface:

# Defines the default VRRP id used for keepalived with haproxy.
# Overwrite it to your value to make sure you don't overlap
# with existing VRRPs id on your network. Default is 10 for the external and 11 for the
# internal VRRPs
# haproxy_keepalived_external_virtual_router_id:
# haproxy_keepalived_internal_virtual_router_id:

# Defines the VRRP master/backup priority. Defaults respectively to 100 and 20
# haproxy_keepalived_priority_master:
# haproxy_keepalived_priority_backup:

# Keepalived default IP address used to check its alive status (IPv4 only)
# keepalived_ping_address: "193.0.14.129"

## DNS Backend Configuration
#  Configuration for the DNS backend that Designate will talk to, Designate
#  supports lots of backends, bind9, powerdns, nsd, djb, dyn, akamai, etc.
#  DNS Backends are configured via a YAML file that Designate reads. The DNS
#  server need not be in the actual Designate container, but for development,
#  or for some internal addressing use cases, it may make sense.

# YAML to use for the Designate pools.yaml file. If this variable is defined,
# a pools.yaml file will be written to /etc/designate/pools.yaml with the
# provided YAML data.
designate_pools_yaml:
  - name: default
    # The name is immutable. There will be no option to change the name after
    # creation and the only way will to change it will be to delete it
    # (and all zones associated with it) and recreate it.

    # Attributes are Key:Value pairs that describe the pool. for example the level
    # of service (i.e. service_tier:GOLD), capabilities (i.e. anycast: true) or
