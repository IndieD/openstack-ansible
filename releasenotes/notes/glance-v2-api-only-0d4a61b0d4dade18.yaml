upgrade:
  - |
    The glance registry service for the v2 API is now disabled by default
    as it is not required and is scheduled to be removed in the future.
    The service can be enabled by setting ``glance_enable_v2_registry``
    to ``True``. As the glance v1 API is still enabled by default, and
    it requires the registry service, the glance-registry service will
    still remain running and operational as before. If the variable
    ``glance_enable_v1_api`` is set to ``False`` then both the v1 API
    and the registry service will be disabled and removed.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``glance_enable_v1_registry`` variable has been removed. When using
    the glance v1 API the registry service is required, so having a variable
    to disable it makes little sense. The service is now enabled/disabled
    for the v1 API using the ``glance_enable_v1_api`` variable.
fixes:
  - |
    When the ``glance_enable_v2_registry`` variable is set to ``True`` the
    corresponding ``data_api`` setting is now correctly set. Previously it
    was not set and therefore the API service was not correctly informed
    that the registry was operating.
